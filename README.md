# Activate Rings Push Clone

# TODO List:
- Better memory management
- More efficient coding (too many for loops/linear time complexity where log complexity is likely possible)
- Mouse 'targeting' on ring buttons - Can still proc life loss clicking between buttons
- Refactor code to include rounds using a difficulty level class to initialize all variables that change between difficulty levels (time, number of buttons for ex.)

  - Under normal circumstances, score would = 0 at time = 0. For the gif, I simply hardcoded 10s of time without adjusting score.
